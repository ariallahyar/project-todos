# Project Todos

The purpose of this project was to continue working with Redux by building a to-do app. The minimum requirements are an app where a user can:
- List all todo tasks, completed or incomplete
- Mark an uncompleted task as complete, and change it back to incomplete
- Add tasks
- Remove taks
- See a count of completed tasks compared to total number of tasks

Stretch goals reached:
- Included a timestamp in the correct local format
- Using Styled Components instead of vanilla CSS.
